I am writing to express my concern regarding recent instances of police brutality in Huntsville outlined herein, as well as to express my support for community-based law enforcement and reallocation of funds toward programs that will build a thriving community in Huntsville. As you are surely aware, protests against police brutality and institutionalized racism within our justice system sparked by the murder of George Floyd have been taking place in every state across the country. In almost every instance, the protesters have been peaceful and respectful, yet firm in their convictions. Unfortunately, in many cases—including some here in Huntsville—the protests have turned violent at the hands of the police and the National Guard. For the first time in the history of our nation, these illegal and unconstitutional acts of brutality are being caught on video, meaning that perpetrators may finally be held to account.%0D%0A%0D%0A Below I’ve included a link to one example of this brutality in our own city. After attacking protesters and forcing them to the ground, Huntsville police began literally kicking citizens while they were down. Even if we were to erroneously assume that the initial use of force was somehow justified, it is plain for anyone to see that there was no need whatsoever to continue attacking people as they lay on the ground.  %0D%0A%0D%0A Here is a link that includes video of the incident: https://twitter.com/ETfonehome97/status/1267657232411435008 %0D%0A%0D%0A As a citizen of Huntsviille, I have become afraid of the men and women who have sworn to protect and serve Huntsvilile. Though some police officers undoubtedly act in good faith, every single officer is a willing participant in a system designed to target, entrap, and brutalize minority members of our community. The only option to ensure that citizens of Huntsville can trust law enforcement mechanisms going forward is to defund the police and reinvest that money into programs that result in people getting the help they deserve after calling 9-1-1, rather than a bullet through their torso, a stun gun to their back, or chemical weapons in their eyes.
